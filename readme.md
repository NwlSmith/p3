## Outside resources
[Raleway Font from Google API](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)

## 3 Unique inputs
1. *Number input for the initial investment*
2. *Select input for the frequency of interest calculations*
3. *Radio input to store whether the calculation uses compound or simple interest*

## Notes for instructor
I purposefully made there be few constraints on the inputs.
I wanted the user to be able to enter:
 - negative interest
 - zero interest
 - zero time periods
